### Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest Id. Return the result table in any order.

Table: Person
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| Id          | int     |
| Email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```
Id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
The query result format is in the following example.
Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
```
Output: 
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

### My Solution

```sql 
with cte as (
select a.id from person a, person b
where a.email = b.email and a.id != b.id and a.id > b.id
)

delete person
from person
inner join cte on person.id=cte.id 
```
### Shortened
```sql
delete a from person a, person b
where a.email = b.email and a.id > b.id
```

### Other Ways
MySql does not allow a subquery with a table that is currently being updated in the outer query, so we trick it by using it indirectly like so: select * from (some_temp_table) as alias table. For example:
```sql
delete from person 
where id not in (
select min(id) from person group by email)
``` 
WILL NOT WORK. Below will work.
```sql
delete from person
where id not in (
select * from (
select min(id) from person group by email) as x)
```
