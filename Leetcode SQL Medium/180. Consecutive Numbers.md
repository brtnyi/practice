**Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively. Return the result table in any order.**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+ 
```
id is the primary key for this table.

The query result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
```
Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

### Solution
```sql
select distinct a.num as ConsecutiveNums
from Logs a, Logs b, Logs c
where a.num = b.num and a.id = b.id-1
and b.num = c.num and b.id = c.id-1
```
